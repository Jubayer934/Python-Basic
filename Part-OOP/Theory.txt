Class and object:

example:
Rabeya
roll=1
gpa=4.40

example:
sakib=2
gpa=4.23

Student
roll
gpa

class= studend
object=rabeya and sakib

Note:
 a class is like a blueprint
 that describes the properties 
 and behaviors of objects, 
 while an object is an actual 
 instance created based on that 
 blueprint, possessing specific attributes
 and being able to perform specific
 actions defined by the class.


Inheritance:
 a system a class can inherit 
 properties and behaviors from 
 another class,

 types of Inheritance
1, Hierarchical Inheritance: a class inheritaned by multiple class
2, Multi level Inheritance: a class inherit by B and B inherit by C.
3, Multiple Inheritance: A inherited by b and c.. then b and c inherit by only one D.


Abstraction: 
Must have to use the method of perents class


Polymorphism:
same method working multiple types.
